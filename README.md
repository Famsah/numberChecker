# NumberChecker Smart Contract

# Overview
The 'NumberChecker' smart contract is a simple Solidity contract that allows users to interact with and modify a stored number 'a'. The contract provides three functions ('testRequire', testAssert', and 'testRevert') to update the stored number based on different conditions and error handling mechanism.

## Fetaures
The 'NumberChecker' contract provides three primamry features for interacting and modifying a stored number 'a'. These features demonstrate different error handling mechansim in Solidity:
1. Initialization: The contract initializes the stored number 'a' to 500 upon deployment.
2. Function 'testRequire': Updates 'a' if the provided number is smaller using 'require' for error hadling.
3. Function 'testAssert': Updates 'a' if the number is smaller using 'assert' to ensure correctness.
4. Function 'testRevert': Update 'a; if the number provided number is smaller using 'revert' for error handling.
